# Mapping Files and Folder Structure with Python (Originally, Accela Migration)

Parses through folders and maps data into CSV file, while recording ID numbers generated from the file/folder names.

This script was originally written for the Urban Planning Department of the City and County of San Francisco, to enable loading 30 years of planning data stored in a folder, into M-Files. The data migration was successful thanks to the precision of the included regex.

This script may then, be easily modified to accommodate the mapping of folder structures and files, for similar tasks, such as migration to different systems, or batch modification of files/folders.

## Last Modified:

The final version of this script was released 02/20/2018.
Subsequent updates may follow as needed.

This is a standalone script. Simply download the latest version (accela_migration_v3.py) and double click it to run it. The generated CSV will be stored in the same folder where the script is ran.

### Prerequisites
